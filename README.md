# openLCA Manual

The openLCA manual is compiled from the resources in this repository using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). Thus, you need to have the `mdbook` executable installed (one simple option is to just download the `mdbook` executable from the [mdBook releases page](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases) and put it next to the `book.toml` file at the root of this project). Then you can run the build from the command line:

```bash
cd path/to/this/openLCA-manual

mdbook build
```

See also the [mdBook tutorial](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) for more options to test the book locally.
