You can search the library by "EPD", "impact category", and more. With an active database, it's possible, then, to import the results by right-clicking on the desired entry and selecting "import selected". If you have imported an EPD then it shall appear under the "EPD" folder in the working database. If you have imported an impact category, it shall appear under the "impact categories" folder and so on. To integrate results of EPD into the product system, please refer to ["Using results of EPDs in the product systems"](./life_cycle_models.md) section.
