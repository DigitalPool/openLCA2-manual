# What you can do with openLCA

<div style='text-align: justify;'>

In a nutshell, openLCA is a tool for modelling and assessing life cycles, performing Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). This covers modelling the life cycle in a narrow sense, by connecting processes visually or via tables, assessing them, regarding environmental, economic or social impacts, and analysing these results for the identification of hotspots. Also comparisons of products are possible, and also assessments and comparisons of organisations.

Many different "variants" of life cycle models are possible in openLCA, for example:

-	Carbon footprints according to the GHG protocol, or ISO 14067
-	LCA studies according to ISO 14040
-	LCA studies in line with the Environmental Footprint approach of the European Commission
-	Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) in line with EN15804
-	Screening LCIA studies
-	Organisational LCA studies
-	Life Cycle Costing studies
-	Social LCA studies

And so on.

Linked to this core use of openLCA, you can also import and export data, create and modify life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods, collaborate within a team, and many more things. 

The idea for this manual is to exactly describe, and guide through, these different use cases and applications.
