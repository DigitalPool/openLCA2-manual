# Usage

<div style='text-align: justify;'>

The "Usage" function allows the user to find where the selected "Flow", "Process" etc. is used. For this, right-click on a database element:

![](../media/usage.png)

After clicking on "Usage", the following window will show where the selected process is used:

![](../media/usage_results.png)

This option allows you to know where a process is used, that it’s useful for example if you want to delete a connected process/flow. 

**_Note:_** Moreover, the "Used in processes" section in every product or waste flow ([General information tab](../flows/flow_tabs_contents.md)) shows you a more detailed "Usage" information.
