In openLCA, tags are a feature used to organize and search data objects within the software. 
They provide a way to assign labels or keywords to elements in your LCA model, such as processes, flows, or impact categories.

Each element within openLCA can have multiple tags associated with it. 
To add tags, navigate to the "General information" tab of a flow, process, product system, impact category or the "Project setup" tab of a project, 
and click on "Add a tag." A wizard will appear, allowing you to specify the tag's name and provide a description.

_Usage of Tags_

In addition, users can filter by tags on the Collaboration Server, which is a great way to locate and organise shared data 
if a consistent tagging system is used within the team.
