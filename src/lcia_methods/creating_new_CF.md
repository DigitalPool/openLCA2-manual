# Creating and addung characterization factors

<div style='text-align: justify;'>

In some methods maybe the characterization factors of an substance are missing. Hence you can add (or modify existing) characterization factors (CFs) in a LCIA method.

To add a CF to a LCIA method:

1. Open the method and the respective category you want to add your CF to. Change from "General Information" to "Characterization factors"
2. Click on the green plus in the upper right cornern and select the flow you want to add the CF to and confirm with "OK":

The flow now has the CF of 1. By selecting the field "Factor", you can modify this number.
